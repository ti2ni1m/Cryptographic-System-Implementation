To open and run the programs of both SDES and RSA, unzip the main 'Practical-Assignment.zip' and you will have two files containing the programs. 
In each file, open up the .cs file where you will get the codes. 
To run the program, you can click on the down button next to play and click "Run associated project with this file".
If not working, add the Practical-Assignment file into the WorkSpace, then open up a New Terminal by clicking Terminal section next to Run and select Practical Assignment.
